## cv-builder

So basically I was tired of editing my CV in Open Office. Adding anything new made the whole layout break. 'Never again!', I said to myself, and I've a custom, programmatically-driven builder, targeted to fulfill my very own needs. With JavaScript, React and Gatsby - technologies that I enjoy using. Now updating the data, improving the layout and so on will be like a breeze. At least I hopse so. :)

If you want to use it as well - go for it! Any feedback would be more than welcome.

Just edit the source files in `src/data` or other files - currently it's filled with example stuff - and run `npm run develop`. Gatsby handles all the hot module replacement stuff.
